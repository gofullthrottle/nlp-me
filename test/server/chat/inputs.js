  'As you can see, I have memorized this utterly useless piece of information long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. You’ve taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations.',
  'I think night time is dark so you can imagine your fears with less distraction.',

  'What do I think of the Muslim preacher who constantly reads from the Koran when I\'m walking through town? He annoys me, but as he has never directly told me I\'m going to hell he annoys me slightly less than the local priest.',
  'The worst part of being a Muslim, is that you are always accused, just for being a Muslim.',
  'Sunnis believe that it was for the believers to form a committee to choose the next leader after Muhammad, and that it should be a decision made by the community. They chose Muhammad\'s lifelong friend Abu Bakr.',
  'The two main branches of Islam are Sunni and Shi\'a. Together they constitute more than 99% of all Muslims.  Roughly speaking, Sunnis constitute between 85 and 90 per cent of the world\'s Muslims, with another 10-15% being Shi\'a.',
  'As for the UK, religious culture has always been very different from that of the US. Wearing your religion on your sleeve is considered gauche. The move to secularism has been a lot longer coming, and it really picked up speed after the Second World War, when the welfare state began to do more to look after people. We still have an established church, but this is more of a gentle background hum. People are are raised without a religion and feel little need for one. They\'re those atheists that religious people on Quora can\'t seem to fathom: they didn\'t actively reject religion, they just never had one. It’s kind of like never buying kiwi fruit. You don\'t dislike it, but you don\'t see any particular reason to spend money on it, either.',
  'In the US, it\'s because the Christians with the most visible public presence are also the worst advertisements for Christianity. There are many tolerant, peaceful Christians in the USA doing valuable charitable work. Do they get any air time? No. It\'s all the loud, socially-conservative evangelicals threatening damnation who, in the public mind, represent what Christianity is. This is a major turn-off to younger people.',
  'As I\'ve said elsewhere, not having a religion is like not playing lacrosse. You don\'t spend all your time thinking about not playing lacrosse; you just don\'t play. It\'s not scary to not play lacrosse. In fact, many people who don\'t play lacrosse have never even heard of lacrosse. Likewise, many atheists know nothing about religion and care even less.',
  'To put things in modern American terms, Jesus was about the equivalent of a second or third tier televangelist in his day. He lived, picked up a few followers along with many other eschatological preachers, and died in a way that wasn’t terribly remarkable. They as a group were interesting but there were quite a few of them and in his life Jesus wasn’t that remarkable. Christianity probably owes more to the man born Saul of Tarsus and his being found in an epileptic fit by one of the followers of Jesus than it does to Jesus himself. But that’s not the sort of person people would bother making up.',
  'Fundamentally Jesus wasn’t terribly important in his time. If you read the Bible, Jesus was a travelling preacher with about a dozen regular followers. He tried to gain legitimacy from John the Baptist and his sect was poor enough it couldn’t afford a horse so he had to ride in to town on a donkey. And he wasn’t killed for blasphemy (the punishment for which was stoning) but for preaching insurrection - the thing crucifixion was used as a punishment for. The nativity accounts are complete nonsense. No one went to their birthplace to be taxed.',
  'All of life occupies its branch on a common tree. Look at skeletons for, say, chimps and humans. The similarities are staggering. Go a bit further afield. Dogs, say. Loads of similarities. On and on.',
  'Several of Jesus’ closest followers began writing what they had witnessed. They used their own memories, testimonies from other witnesses, and whatever written records of Jesus they had. The similarities between these three accounts that we have lead us to believe that they used at least one common document— either Mark or something called “Q.”',
  'After Jesus had left and before the gospels were written, the early Christian church passed around letters and stories and sayings and personal accounts. Because Jesus’ resurrection was so fresh in people\'s minds, there was no need for a full and standardized written account. They had lived it.',
  'There is not a single teaching of Jesus Christ that I find exemplified by Donald Trump. He is, for all intents and purposes, adjectivally, “anti-Christ”, in that virtually everything he does and says is opposed to every example that Jesus Christ set for us. I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around a born-again Believer casting a vote for someone so thoroughly enraptured with wickedness.',
  'Christianity was not invented, really... it was more of something that came to be when people began to gather after the resurrection of Jesus to follow his teachings.  In terms of the name "Christianity," it came about from a Roman insult.  People in that time who followed Jesus and his teachings referred to him as "The Christ," meaning he was the savior.  The Romans mistook the word to be his last name, and therefore referred to him as "Jesus Christ," as opposed to "Jesus THE Christ."  As an insult, they referred to groups of Jesus followers as "Christians."  If you would like to know more about the origins of Christianity, I would recommend Andy Stanley\'s series "Christian," talking about the origins of the word, the faith and what should be expected of followers.

  'He worked hard and took out the star in Fernando Torres. Under him, the team looked really united,every player worked hard in a team throughout 90 minutes. Defenders looks in coherence with strikers. Torres was noticed and he had to sell him. Instead of trying to stop him, he focused on utilizing his limited resources. He believed on team as a whole than individual players.',
  ' Diego came and taught Hard working,endurance and team work. He turned individual ordinary players into hard working team. The ordinary players became world beaters. He didn\'t purchased world stars like Guardiola or mourinho, he turned his average players into Stars through teaching team work and endurance.',
  'I\’m sorry to say that programmers will not be a high priority on Mars. You can write code anywhere, and it’s very expensive to send people to Mars. The only people who will go to Mars will be those who have special skills that are required by the Martian environment.',
  'I\'ve been following the commercial launch industry since OTRAG in the late 1970\'s. For those of us who\'ve been waiting decades for a fully-capable, commercially viable launcher, the Falcon 9 is a pretty big deal.',
  'I think about it this way: After the financial crisis, where were the full-scale public investigations? Where were the armies of auditors, seizing hard drives and poring over the financial statements? Where were the teams of regulators who were supposed to be checking the books all along? Where were the task forces — the combined efforts of federal and state officials — who cross-examined low-level dealers and got them to tell what the big guys were up to? Where were the signs — any signs at all — that real resources were devoted to thorough investigations and that somebody with real power was taking this responsibility seriously?',
  'This gags me. I recently put out a report called “Rigged Justice” – highlighting 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures of 2015. In a single year, in case after case, across many sectors of the economy, federal agencies caught giant companies breaking the law — defrauding taxpayers, covering up deadly safety problems, even triggering the financial collapse in 2008 — and let them off the hook with barely a slap on the wrist. These companies paid meager fines, which some then handed over to their tax lawyers to see if they could get a tax deduction!',
  'He\'s a Rhodes Scholar graduate of Stanford (where he was Class President and played varsity football) and Yale Law School. He\'s the Mayor of one of the 75 largest American cities (larger than Buffalo, Orlando, or Salt Lake City, and the largest in New Jersey), having turned down an offer from the Obama administration to head the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy. By the end of this year, he will probably be one of just two African-American members of the United States Senate, from which he will be regarded even more seriously than he already is as a potential Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate.',
  'Yeah. He’s making a b-line for the White House. He’s young feller: 47 as of now (2016 August). He’s got time to burn. If Clinton wins in 2016, he should polish his chops in the Senate until 2020. If she wins again in 2020, he needs to beg her for the Secretary of State, Defense or some other prominent internationally facing position.',
  'The most important thing I learned from this election is that (more than) half of America actually thinks otherwise. They were just silent about it in the past, and now they are saying it out loud by casting their votes. Better know this explicitly sooner than later.',
  'Most American Sarracenis (Pitcher Plants) will live quite nicely outside in your area. They require a special type of soil and constant water. The Roundleaf Sundew might live there, and the Venus Flytrap probably too. These all require a cold or cool spell to live from year to year.',
  'At this moment, as I type this, Bill Mahar is fully-baked, drunk or both. There’s a tiny chance that when he wakes up he’s going to seriously try to figure out how to get his hat in the ring, moving from entertainer to politician. It’s more likely to be unserious speculation, but he’s gonna think it.',
  'Oprah Winfrey probably won’t get into the scrum, but she would sure make a mark if she did. She has national appeal, she’s better at business than Trump, she knows policy, and she has presence. The worst public skeletons she has are some of the people she has promoted via her show, but that might get swept away because Oprah.',
  'Cory Booker has a political resume that’s somewhat similar to Bernie, excepting Bernie’s time in the House. He’s young, handsome, charismatic, black, has no major baggage, and is acceptably centrist to party leaders. I don’t think he’s a lock, but he’d be a very strong contender.',
  'Lawrence Lessig has gone back to teaching. He was a one-issue candidate. Unless he changes that, he’s not going to win the White House.',
  'Joe Biden might consider it. Time will have helped heal family wounds a little, and he is drawn to service. Given this election cycle, I think his gaffes would be mild compared to our President-elect.',
  'Elizabeth Warren didn’t show an interest in running this time. She will be fresh off her 2018 re-election bid. She will wait and see how much the country slumps these next two years. If it’s enough, she may put her hat in the ring.',
